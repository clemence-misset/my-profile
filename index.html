		<p class="text justify"> I'm a french girl, I was born in Paris. But I had the chance to live abroad for 2 years in Tahiti and 2 years in Tunisia. Those great opportunities gave me a certain open mindedness and made me love travelling. During vacations, I've discoverd new places. Menorca and La Plagne are some of my favourites. I'm currently living in Cergy, where I'm a first year student of ESSEC global BBA. Also,  I'm an active member of the association SCOOL & CO. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I'm not really into sport but I really like skying and playing golf.  </p>

		Travelling 
	    <p class="justify">
		 
		 Living in Tunisia and Tahiti, helped me extend my vision of the world, by discovering it through new landscapes and cultures. According to me, travelling makes us growing up and shape our minds as well as having a better understanding of the world. 

		 I especially loved Menorca because, first of all, the island is amazing. The landscapes are very pretty, and the isle is very preserved from the human destruction. For instance, there is huge natural parc.
		 I felt like people where very nice and chill.

	   Association
		<p class="justify">
		 
		 As I said before, I'm part of the association S'COOL&CO. It's purpose, is to help young kids from elmentary schools living in the suburbs of Cergy to do their homeworks. I always wanted to do some humanitarian stuff, therefore, I'm pretty glad to do some and at my level, help people. I see them once a week, every thursdays. I love the fact that beyond the duty we have to help them, we can build some relations, which is, according to me, the coolest thing. I feel like, being part of this association made me grow up in a sens that we can learn from each other. Also it made me developp my patience.

		Reading 
		<p class="justify">
			It's one of the activities that I like the most. Whenever I have some free time, I like to read. According to me, it's prefect to evacuate stress and anxiety by jumping in a new universe, that put us away from the reality and the real world. Here is the list of my favorit eones:
			<ol class="justify">
				<li> L'enfer c'est les autres -- Jean-Paul sartre </li>
				<li> The handmaid's tale -- Margaret Atwood</li>
				<li>Je voudrais que quelqu'un m'attende quelquepart -- Anna Gavalda</li>
				<li>Pauca Meae -- Victor Hugo </li>
				</li>
			</ol>
